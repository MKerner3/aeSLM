{
  "question": "Discuss the implications of entropy generation in irreversible processes and its relationship to the second law of thermodynamics.",
  "answer": "Entropy represents the thermal energy's inability to perform useful work. In irreversible processes, entropy generation occurs due to dissipative phenomena like turbulence and friction, moving systems towards thermodynamic equilibrium, where entropy is maximized. The second law of thermodynamics asserts that in an isolated system, entropy always increases for irreversible processes and remains constant for reversible ones. The Clausius inequality further states that entropy production due to irreversibility is always positive."

{
  "question": "Discuss the concept of shock waves and expansion fans and their impact on flow properties.",
  "answer": "Shock waves are caused when flow velocity exceeds the speed of sound and/or there is an abrupt decrease in flow area. Across a shock, static pressure, temperature, and density increase almost instantaneously and the mach number decreases. Expansion fans occur when flow passes a convex corner and the changes in flow properties are opposite of shocks. Because flow accross shocks is non-isentropic, total pressure downstream of the shock is less than upstream. As expansions fans are isentropic, the total pressure remains constant."

  "question": "Explain how Bernoulli's equation applies to parallel and curved streamlines. How does pressure vary in bends? Under what conditions is it valid?",
  "answer": "For this, neglect the effects of gravity. In parallel streamlines, dp/dr = 0, meaning there is no pressure gradient and the equation is simply P + 1/2*rho*v^2 = const. In curved streamlines of radius r, dp/dr = rho*(v^2/r) where v is the tangential velocity, there is a pressure gradient across the streamlines. Therefore, having this additional term, outside a bend as the radius is larger, the pressure is larger. Bernoulli's equation is only valid for flows that are steady, incompressible, and inviscid (no flow friction)."

{
  "question": "What is the difference between a system and a control volume, why is it important?",
  "answer": "A system is a region of space in which the mass remains constant, meaning mass cannot cross the system boundary. It can also alter its shape and volume. In control volumes mass is allowed to cross its boundaries but cannot alter its shape of volume. However, it can move at constant speed. A system can be applied to a piston containing gas under compression and expansion to find the work done and heat transferred. And in fluid flow, control volumes are easier to apply when mass is flowing into and out of a control volume. "

{
  "question": "Explain static, dynamic, stagnation pressure and how they relate in a pitot-static probe?",
  "answer": "Static pressure,p, is the actual pressure at any given point in the flow. It is the pressure measured using a tube placed perpendicular to the flow. Stagnation temperature, p0, is the maximum pressure a fluid can reach when brought to rest isentropically with mechanical losses, i.e., p0 = p + 1/2 * density * velocity^2. It is measured by a pitot-tube facing directly towards the flow at which the fluid velocity is zero at the tube opening. Dynamic pressure is found by taking the stagnation pressure minus the static pressure. Pitot-static probes are placed on aircraft to calculate its speed using Bernoulli's equation."

{
  "question": "Consider a cyclic heat engine operating between two heat reservoirs at different temperatures. Explain how the efficiency of the engine changes if the temperature of the cold reservoir is increased while keeping the temperature of the hot reservoir constant.",
  "answer": "First, given the parameters, assume the process is reversible. The efficiency of a heat engine is given by the ratio of the work output to the heat input. For reversible processes, we can write the efficiency,n, as n = 1 - Tc/Th, where Tc and Th are temperatures of the cold and hot reservoir respectively. As the temperature of the cold reservoir (Tc) is increased while keeping the temperature of the hot reservoir (Th) constant, the efficiency of the engine decreases. This is because the temperature difference (Th - Tc) decreases. "

{
  "question": "How is choked flow achieved in a convergent nozzle and what are its implications?",	
  "answer": "The fluid velocity can be manipulated by changing the exit static pressure. Choked flow occurs when the fluid reaches Mach 1 at the throat. To achieve Mach 1, the exit static pressure is decreased until the ratio of inlet stagnation pressure over exit static pressure reaches around 1.893. Once you hit Mach 1, flow velocity cannot increase further, even if the exit static pressure decreases. Therefore, the mass flow rate cannot increase and reaches its maximum."
},
{
  "question": "How and why does an increase in the skin friction coefficient affect flow conditions in Fanno flow?",
  "answer": "The increase in friction represents greater wall shear stress as given by the equation Cf = t/(1/2*rho*v^2) where t is the wall shear stress. As t increases, the pressure drop along a duct increases due to larger pressure losses given by dp/dx = -4t/D. As friction serves to reduce the effective area, the choked flow conditions will be reached at a shorter duct length."
},
{
  "question": "On a T-s diagram, compare the constant pressure and volume lines. How are isentropic processes related?",
  "answer": "For constant pressure, dp = 0, therefore the Tds equation simplifies to (dT/ds) = T/Cp, showing that the constant pressure line has a positive slope. As temperature increases, the slope increases. For constant volume, the Tds equation is (dT/ds) = T/Cv. Since, Cv < Cp for a perfect gas, the constant volume line is steeper. An isentropic compression process is represented as a vertical line from a lower constant pressure line to a higher one. The opposite is true for an isentropic expansion process."
