If a process involves taking a specific path that cannot be retraced, it is irreversible. Reversible processes follow a well-defined and retraceable path between the initial and final states. If a process produces entropy between the initial and final states, it is irreversible. If a process involves dissipative effects such as friction, it is irreversible. These lead to energy losses and irreversibilities within the system."

  "question": "When a supersonic aircraft travels at high speeds, the air entering the engine's inlet experiences a rapid change in pressure and velocity. The airflow ahead of the engine is compressed due to the shockwaves generated by the aircraft's forward motion. If, in this compression process, the airflow experiences a rapid change in pressure and velocity without significant heat exchange with the surroundings, is the process adiabatic or not? Why?",

If the compression occurs sufficiently rapidly that there is not have enough time for significant heat exchange between the air and the surroundings, it is adiabatic."

It is useful when applied to highly unsteady or transient flows, such as turbulent flows. The Euelerian description tracks fixed points in space and their flow properties, such as the velocity, pressure and density. It is used to analyze steady flows, focusing on the overall behavior of the flow."

  "question": "What differentiates Couette and Poiseuille flow and how do favorable and unfavorable pressure gradients relate to these?",
  "answer": "Couette and Poiseuille flow are two distinct types of viscous flow. Couette flow occurs between two parallel plates, with one stationary and the other moving at a constant velocity, whereas Poiseuille flow occurs in a long, straight pipe with constant cross-sectional area, where a pressure difference is applied along the length of the pipe. It is also important to note that in Couette flow, the velocity gradient arises due to the relative motion of the plates, creating a shearing motion within the fluid. The velocity profile in Couette flow is linear, with the velocity increasing linearly from zero at the stationary plate to a maximum value at the moving plate. In Poiseuille flow, the pressure difference drives the flow, moving from high to low pressure. The velocity profile in Poiseuille flow is parabolic, with the maximum velocity occurring at the centerline of the pipe and decreasing towards the walls. In a favorable pressure gradient, the pressure decreases in the direction of flow, meaning that fluid increases in velocity along the flow direction. In an adverse pressure gradient, the pressure increases in the direction of flow, so the fluid decreases in velocity along the flow direction."

{
  "question": "How does one distinguish between the static, stagnation, and total pressure, and what equations can be used to calculate them?",
  "answer": "The static pressure, p, can be described as the actual pressure at any given point in the flow. It represents the pressure that a fluid exerts perpendicular to any surface when the fluid is not in motion relative to the surface. It is the pressure that one would measure with a sensor at a fixed point in the flow, without altering its velocity. The stagnation pressure, p0, can be described as the pressure a fluid would have if it were brought to rest. In other words, it is the static pressure at a stagnation point – where the local velocity of the fluid is zero. It can be calculated using the following equation, which sums the free-stream static and dynamic pressures: p0 = p + (1/2)*rho*v^2. The total pressure, pt, sometimes used interchangeably with the stagnation pressure, differentiates itself from the stagnation pressure in situations where the effects of gravity need to be taken into consideration. It can be calculated using the following equation: p + (1/2)*rho*v^2 + rho*g*h."

  "question": "In a converging-diverging nozzle, what happens to the flow depending on whether the flow is subsonic or supersonic, and how does exit static pressure affect the flow behavior?",
  "answer": "If the flow entering the nozzle is subsonic, the flow velocity will increase and static pressure decrease in the converging section, and the flow velocity will decrease and static pressure increase in the diverging section. If the flow entering the nozzle is supersonic, it behaves in the opposite way. The flow velocity will decrease and static pressure increase in the converging section, and the flow velocity will increase and static pressure decrease in the diverging section. Regarding shocks, if the flow remains supersonic through the nozzle and a shock develops in the diverging section, decreasing the exit static pressure decreases the pressure ratio across the shock, causing the shock to move downstream through the nozzle. In certain extreme cases when the exit static pressure is sufficiently reduced, the shock can even leave the exit of the nozzle."
