# QUESTIONS
[
#1
{
  "question": "Can we apply Bernoulli's principle for shocks?",
  "answer": "Shocks occur as the object reaches transsonic or supersonic flow (M>1) while Bernoulli's principle works effectively at M<0.3. One can apply afore mentioned principle but a several assumptions have to be applied: incompressiblility, steady inviscid flow along the streamlines, and no external forces acting on the flow. Under all assumptions, we can use Bernoulli's principle, but results would be far off from a reality, making it highly inefficient."
},
 #2   
{
  "question": "How is the internal energy of an ideal gas affected during an adiabatic process, where no heat is exchanged with the surroundings?",
  "answer": "During an adiabatic process, the internal energy decreases. This decrease occurs because work done by the gas against external forces results in reduction of its internal energy which is explained by the First Thermodynamics Law."
},
    #3
{
  "question": "Under what circumstances can the assumption of negligible shaft work be made?",
  "answer": "Such assumption can be made for steady state processses with little to none mechanical effects, processes where only interaction is through the heat transfer or during ideal gas expansions/compressions."
},
    #4
{
  "question": "Why do pressure lines exhibit curvature on an enthalpy-entropy (h-s) graph?",
  "answer": "The curvature of pressure lines on an enthalpy-entropy (h-s) graph occurs because specific enthalpy is a function of both pressure and temperature. When pressure is held constant, changes in temperature lead to variations in specific enthalpy, resulting in curved lines on the h-s graph.",

{
"question": "Can entropy be subject to conservation principles?",
"answer": "Entropy is a nonconserved property, and there is no such thing as the conservation of entropy principle. Entropy remains constant during idealized reversible processes and increases during all actual processes.",

    {
"question": "Why exactly pressure drops along the pipe?",
"answer": "The pressure loss occurs when frictional forces, caused by the resistance to flow, act on a fluid as it flows through a conduit.",

  ]
    },
    #7
    {
"question": "Why expansion fans are insetropic?",
"answer": "Expansion fan is formed of Mach waves. Since the flow turning gradually with each succesive wave (unlike shocks), and each Mach wave is isentropic, then the flow across the expansion fan is also isentropic.",

    { 
"question": "Can heat be transferred to a liquid without inducing a change in its temperature?",
"answer": "Yes, it is possible during the phase transformations (vaporization, melting) or if the liquid does work on a system. For this to be possible we have to assume steady state, adiabatic conditions and no external work for the system. "
},
    #9
    {
"question": "Why pitot tube has to be turned towards the direction of the flow?",
"answer": "Assuming the tube is not aligned properly, the dynamic pressure component would not be captured properly due to the turbulence. This results in total pressure distortion meaning wrong pressure reading."
