  "question": "Can you break down the State Postuate? What is each element of the principle?",
  "answer": "The state of a simple compressible system is completely specified by two independent, intensive properties.

To further break down the postulate, we need to define some terms:

A simple compressible system is a system without electrical, magnetical, gravitational, motion, and surface tension effects. An intensive property is one that doesn't change with size. For example, volume is NOT an intensive property but density and specific volume are. For properties to be independent, one must be able to be varied while keeping the other constant. Independent properties may change depending on the system."

  "question": "How is pressure measured? What are common measurement devices and how do they vary?",
  "answer": "A manometer is a 'U'-shaped device that measures an applied pressure. The device contains a liquid that has a displacement in height after the pressure is applied. This way one end has the applied pressure and the other has the atmospheric pressure. We can then use the pressure vs depth equation (p_2 = p_1 + rho(g)(h)) and known values to find the applied pressure.

A barometer works similarly with the displacement of height, but we are comparing an applied pressure to the pressure of a vacuum.

A pitot tube measures stagnation and static pressure through two openings. One that faces towards the flow measures stagnation pressure while the tube opening at 90 degrees measures static pressure. The difference calculated can be interpreted as the dynamic pressure."

{
  "question": "What is the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics and why was it required to be established before the 1st-3rd Laws?",
  "answer": "If two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third body, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.

Having the zeroth law gives us a set definition and key property of temperature. It was named the zeroth law even though it was created after the first and second laws because the zeroth law provides necessary assumptions to apply the others.

For example, this established temperature as a property: bodies in thermal equilibrium have the same temperature. It also gave meaning to the Kelvin scale where it is measured from an absolute zero: where enthalpy and entropy are minimized."

{
  "question": "What is an adiabatic process, and how can we distinguish if a process is adiabatic?",
  "answer": "An adiabatic process is one where no heat is transferred, often used in equations as Q = 0. In general, systems that are insulated can be assumed to be adiabatic. Processes that also occur quickly can be assumed to be adiabatic since there is no time for heat to be transferred.

If a system is adiabatic, we can make more assumptions if given other conditions. For example, adiabatic and reversible processes are also isentropic."
},
{
  "question": "How can we compare the lift resulting from the Magnus effect to the lift generated in a standard airfoil?",
  "answer": "The Magnus Effect occurs when a spinning object travels through a fluid. The spin can generate a force that curves the object's trajectory. In the case of a cylinder rotating in a flow, this can generate lift.

This occurs because speaking in simple terms and Newton's Third Law, the spin pushs the air down which pushes the cylinder up. What's really happening when the air is "pushed down" is that a pressure differential is created (high pressure under the cylinder, low above the cylinder) which generated lift.

This pressure differential is the same thing that causes lift in a standard airfoil, but instead of being generated by spin, an airfoil's lift is generated through its geometry."

{
  "question": "What does the Del Operator represent and what are some of its applications in other equations?",
  "answer": "In the scope of this course, the del operator takes on 3 main roles calculating: gradient, divergence, and advection.

Firstly, the del operator is defined as taking the partial derivative of the x-component with respect to x, the y-component with respect to y, and the z-component with respect to z.

Just taking the del operator of a vector will give you the gradient which is also a vector. The gradient shows directions where the value increases.

Taking the dot product of the del operator and a vector is called the divergence. The divergence (a scalar) tells you net flux of each point (how many vectors are pointing to this point in a way). If divergence is greater than zero then the point is a source. If less than zero, then the point is a sink. If it is zero then neither apply.

Taking the dot product of velocity and the del operator of a value gives us advection which can be described as the rate of change of the value given the velocity. Advection is a scalar value."

{
  "question": "What are the properties of a sound wave and why do they matter when considering compressible fluid mechanics?",
  "answer": "Sound waves are longitudinal waves as opposed to transverse waves. This means in a sound wave there are regions of compression and rarefaction. During the transition between these regions the temperature and pressure vary adiabatically.

We can calculate the speed of sound using conservation and momentum equations to derive it as a function of the derivative of pressure with respect to density. With more rearranging with adiabatic relations and ideal gas law, we can derive a function for the speed of sound with respect to temperature and gas constants.

This allows us to rewrite equations in terms of Mach number rather than velocity and density because writing in terms of Mach number and gamma is more useful in incompressible fluid dynamics then writing in velocity and density as we are used to."
},
{
  "question": "What is a choked flow? What are two ways for a flow to reach Mach 1?",
  "answer": "Using conservation of mass, the 1D Euler equation, and the definition of the speed of sound, we can derive an equation that solves for the change in area as a function of Mach Number and acceleration.

When viewing the equation it beomces evident that when M = 1, dA/dx must be equla to zerom, indicating a minimum area. This region of minimum area is called the throat, and if M = 1 is reached, we can say the throat is choked. This means if the incoming flow is M < 1, and the throat is choked, then the resulting flow will be supersonic.

Since one way to choke a flow is reducing the area, another way this could be acheived is reducing the effective area through friction. Increasing the Mach Number using a converging nozzle is equivalent to increasing the Mach Number through a rough pipe."
},
{
  "question": "How do expansion fans differ from shocks? What causes their properties to change after the expansion/shock?",
  "answer": "Expansion fans are defined as a continuous sequence of Mach Waves. Mach waves change the flow by a dtheta and dv. They are generated as supersonic flow passes by a convex corner.

Shocks are created in supersonic flow passing by a concave corner (oblique shock) or just in supersonic flow (normal shock). This occurs because when flow is supersonic, the fluid blobs that normally react in density variations cannot move in time. Shocks are an intense build up of pressure that result in a drop in stagnation pressure.

Unlike shocks, expansion fans are isentropic. This means that stagnation temperature and stagnation pressure are constant before and after the expansion fan. In a shock, Mach number decrease while in an expansion fan, Mach number increases. In a shock, density increases, static pressure increases, and static enthalpy increases. In an expansion fan, density decreases, static pressure decreases, and static enthalpy decreases."

The assumptions is that the flow is viscid (there are shear forces) and there is no driving pressure gradient (dp/dx = 0). Other unlying assumptions is that the flow is axial and incompressible. Using boundary conditions (the flow velocity is equal to the plate velocity at the plates), Couette flow states that flow velocity is a linear function of the distance from a plate.

Poiseuille Flow occurs when fluid moves between two stationary plates. This time instead of being driven by the movement of a plate (Couette Flow), Poiseuille Flow is driven by a constant pressure gradient. The assumptions is that the flow is axial and imcompressible. Using boundary conditions (flow velocity should be 0 at stationary plates), Poiseuille Flow states that velocity is a parabolic function with respect to distance from a plate and the direction of the pressure gradient."
