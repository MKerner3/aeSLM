    "question": "How do pitot tubes measure fluid velocity?"
    "answer": "Pitot tubes don't actually measure the velocity of a fluid, rather the differences in pressure. A hole head-on to the flow measures the stagnation pressure (when velocity is zero) while the smaller tubes on the sides measure static pressure. By utilizing Bernoulli's equation where velocity on one side is zero, stagnation pressure is equal to static pressure plus dynamic pressure--which is (1/2)rho*v^2 where rho is density and v is velocity. Using the measured pressures from the pitot tube, one can either use a computer or manually solve for velocity."

{
    "question": "Why is the minimum pressure at the center of curvature for curved streamlines?"
    "answer": "The pressure is minimized at the center of pressure in short due to Newton's second law and a modified application of Bernoulli's equation along curved streamlines. Along curves, normal acceleration must be balanced by a normal pressure force. To stay along the curve, there must be a centripetal acceleration caused by a pressure gradient acting normal to the streamlines. Mathematically, this can be noted by integrating dp/dn = p(V^2/R) and realizing that p is at its minimum when the distance from R is minimized."

{
    "question": "What is the difference between divergence and advection?"
    "answer": "Divergence essentially measures the change of a vector field (commonly velocity). It can dictate if a flow sources or sinks with respect to a specific point. Advection  is defined as 'Advection is defined as the exchange of energy, moisture, or momentum as a result of horizontal heterogeneity.' It is important to note that while this is the definition of advection, the operator is used in this course and can be generalized. It is more similar to divergence, but gives the variation of some other variable as velocity (or some other rate of change) changes across a vector field. Mathematically, divergence is simply the derivatives of the 3D components of velocity. The advection operator multiplies the components of velocity (or some other variable) by the derivative of some other variable with respect to space."

{
    "question": "Why can some processes be treated as adiabatic and why is this important?"
    "answer": "An adiabatic process is one in which no heat transfer occurs. As heat transfer takes time, processes that occur very rapidly may not be able to transfer heat. Because of this and the first law, change in internal energy can be set equal to the negative work done on the system and therefore the net work done can be considered independent of the path taken."
},
{
    "question": "Why is the efficiency of a heat engine maximimum when the process is reversible?"
    "answer": "A reversible heat engine is more efficient essentially due to the second law of thermodynamics. Reversible processes can be returned to their original state and can do so with no change in entropy, while irreversibilities occur with an increase in entropy. Irreversibilities occur for a multitude of reasons, but result in 'lost work' that makes the process less efficient. For example, energy lost from friction cannot be regained and used as energy in the system."

},
{
    "question": "Why can't irreversible processes be plotted on p-V diagrams and what is the compromise?"
    "answer": "Many times, reversible processes take place in quasi-equilibrium, so they are able to be graphed according to equilibrium states. Irreversible processes however do not occur where p-V are in equilibrium and therefore cannot be represented with a continuous line. Instead, it is often graphed with a dotted line to indicate a process has taken place from point A to point B, but irreversibly."
},
{
    "question": "Why does the entropy of a system approach its maximum as it tends towards equilibrium?"
    "answer": "For an isolated system there is no change in work done as there is nothing to do work or do work on. As dS = dQ/dt + dS(irrev), dS = dS(irrev). So irreversible processes that change entropy are the only processses that can happen to move towards equilibrium. And as dS(irrev) can only be positive or zero, entropy can only keep increasing as it approaches its maximum amount."
},
{
    "question": "In Fanno flow, how do subsonic and supersonic flow have both similar and opposite behavior?"
    "answer": "The upper (starting subsonic) and lower (starting supersonic) curves cannot be transversed by the same curve. However they both are adiabatic processes and approach a sonic point of maximum entropy where the flow is choked. Similarly, total pressure decreases for both flows, though static increases for supersonic and decreases for subsonic. As for most other properties, they act oppositely. This mostly revolves around their different behaviors as the area effectively decreases due to friction. From standard mass flow rate conventions, subsonic flow speeds up to reach Mach 1 while supersonic slows down as area decreases."

{
    "question": "How can oblique shocks be treated as normal shocks?"
    "answer": "Oblique shock properties can be calculated like normal shocks simply by tilting the frame of reference so that the shock is perpendicular to the frame. To accomodate this one must calculate the Mach component and use that in the normal shock equations."
