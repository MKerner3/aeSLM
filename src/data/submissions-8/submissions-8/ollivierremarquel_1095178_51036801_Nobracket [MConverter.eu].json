  "question": "In what type of flows can Bernoulli’s principle be applied?",
  "answer": "Bernoulli’s can be applied at low speed, inviscid (without flow friction or viscous effects), and incompressible steady flow. It is applied to flow along a streamline, where the flow can be rotational or irrational. However, if the flow is rotational, Bernoulli holds between any 2 points in the flow, not necessarily just on the same streamline. If the flow is irrotational, Bernoulli’s can apply across streamlines."

{
  "question": "What is the difference between Couette Flow and Poiseuille Flow, and when can each be applied?",
  "answer": "Both Couette and Poiseuille flows are both examples of viscous flows. Couette flow is considered to flow between a moving and stationary plate. The pressure gradient between the two plates is 0, and the flow is driven solely by the shearing motion of the plates rather than pressure differences. Poiseuille flow is a flow between 2 stationary plates, driven by a constant pressure gradient induced by a constant pressure difference or pressure drop in a pipe or between 2 parallel plates. Poiseuille flow is axisymmetric and swirl-free. Poiseuille flow can be observed in blood flow or through pipes, while Couette Flow can be observed in engineering applications involving lubrication between 2 surfaces, like a bearing. "

{
  "question": "Why is there a pressure gradient across curved streamlines?",
  "answer": "Neglecting gravitational forces, consider a fluid blob traveling along a curved streamline. The acceleration is in the normal direction towards the center of curvature. This acceleration wouldn’t exist if it were traveling in a straight path. When the streamline is curved, a normal pressure force must balance the normal acceleration, and that normal pressure force keeps the fluid moving in its curved path. Due to curvature, fluid moves at higher velocities towards the inside of the curvature, and following Bernoulli’s equation, low pressure is related to high velocity, causing a pressure gradient with low pressure towards the inside of the curve and high pressure on the outside."

  "question": "What is the significance of the Clausius Inequality in irreversible and reversible processes? ",
  "answer": "For an irreversible process, the Clausius Inequality strictly says that heat transfer occurs WITH irrecoverable energy loss. This holds because an irreversible process means the system cannot be brought to its original state without external help. For reversible processes, equality (in the Clausius Inequality itself) applies when all processes within the cycle are reversible. Heat transfer occurs WITHOUT any irrecoverable energy losses, and the system changes in a quasi-equilibrium matter. "

{
  "question": "How does entropy relate to the directionality and irreversibility of processes in nature?",
  "answer": "Entropy represents the inability of a system’s thermal energy to yield useful work. Processes favor the direction that leads to an increase in entropy, like heat flowing from a hot object to a cold one. In irreversible processes, entropy increases, leading to a loss of the ability to perform useful work. Reversible processes allow quasi-equilibrium changes, allowing a system to be brought back to its original state without any entropy change. "
},
{
  "question": "What are adiabatic, isobaric, isochoric, isentropic, and isothermal processes, and how can I relate them? ",
  "answer": "The adiabatic process occurs when no heat is exchanged between the system and its surroundings. Isobaric processes occur at constant pressure, isochoric processes occur at constant volume, and isothermal processes occur at constant temperature. An isentropic process occurs with no change in entropy. Relating these processes depends on the conditions and behaviors of the system and can overlap. In isentropic processes, the system remains adiabatic. An adiabatic process can be isentropic if it is reversible. Isothermal processes can be isochoric or isobaric if they occur at constant volume or pressure."

{
  "question": "Why do we consider flow across an expansion fan isentropic?",
  "answer": "Isentropic flow assumes energy conservation and moment without losses due to friction, heat transfer, and shock waves when we consider it isentropic. It is also associated with ideal gas behavior, and the fact that entropy stays in contrast through the expansion process simplifies the analysis of energy changes and heat transfer within a system. Assuming the flox is isentropic allows us to use our isentropic relations to solve flow problems as well. "

{
  "question": "Why does decreasing exit static pressure move a shock in the throat to the exit plane in a supersonic converging-diverging nozzle? ",
  "answer": "Flow reaches its maximum velocity at the throat of the nozzle. Before the throat, flow is supersonic, while after the throat, flow is subsonic. The shock wave depends on the pressures and velocities before and after the throat. The diverging section of the nozzle allows the flow to increase its velocity and decrease its static pressure. If exit static pressure is less than the pressure at the throat, the shockwave will form at the throat, and decreasing the pressure will cause the shock to move toward the exit plane. The pressure ratio/gradient is important to determining shock position."
},
{
  "question": "Why doesn’t the mass flow rate through a converging nozzle increase when reducing exit static pressure in choked flow?",
  "answer": "The mass flow rate doesn’t increase when reducing exit static pressure at the exit because the choked flow is reached at the throat of the nozzle. Choked flow occurs flow at the nozzle reaches Mach 1, and flow is limited by the speed of sound and can’t accelerate further. The communication between the initial conditions at the start of the nozzle and the conditions at the end travel at the speed of sound, so once Mach 1 is hit at the throat, the inlet doesn’t know what’s happening at the exit."
