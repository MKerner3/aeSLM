    "question": "An isolated electrochemical cell indefinitely generates an electrical current. How does this process violate the first law of thermodynamics, “the conservation of energy?",
    "answer": "The first law of thermodynamics states that energy and matter cannot be created or destroyed, but only converted from one form to another. An electrochemical cell that generates electricity is an example in which energy is being created in a closed system without external energy input. Since energy is increasing without outside interference, the first law of thermodynamics is being violated.",

    "question": "What does Archimedes principle state and can this principle be applied to all fluids? What about objects of any shape or size?", 
    "answer": "Archimedes principle states that if a body is partially or wholly submerged, then it receives an upward thrust equivalent to the displaced fluid. All fluids, not just liquids and gases, can be covered by the Archimedes principle. However, as gases are less dense and have a weaker buoyancy factor, it is most often used in liquids. Also, objects of any shape or size shall be subject to this principle, as long as they are completely immersed in the liquid."

    "question": "What is the main function of a pressure regulator in a supersonic wind tunnel?",
    "answer": " In a wind tunnel, air flowing out of the tank results in a pressure drop. The pressure regulator ensures that the mass flow rate remains constant.",

  "question": "What are the distinct character differences between laminar and turbulent flow.",
  "answer": "Laminar flow is where the fluid flows in layers without heavy integration between the layers. Within each layer, the velocity, pressure, and other hydrodynamic properties remain unchanged. Contrarily, turbulent flow displays erratic movements that mix particles between the layers of fluids flowing.  "

  "question": "How does the second law of thermodynamics describe why heat is transferred from a hot object to a cold object?",
  "answer": "The second law states that there exists a useful state variable called entropy. The change in entropy is equal to the heat transfer divided by the temperature. Thus, in a closed system, entropy tends to increase over time. When heat flows from a hot object to a cold object, it increases the overall entropy of the system, as the hot object loses heat and the cold object gains heat. This process tends to move the system towards a state of maximum entropy, which is the state of thermodynamic equilibrium.",

{
  "question": "What is an example of a reversible process? What is an example of an irreversible process? ",
  "answer": "An example of a reversible process would be forcing a flow, with zero viscosity, through a constricted pipe. As the flow moves through the pipe, the pressure, temperature, and velocity would change, but these variables would return to their original values downstream. An example of an irreversible process is putting a hot object in contact with a cold object. Eventually, they both achieve the same equilibrium temperature. If we separate the objects they will not return to their original temperatures.",

{
  "question": "Why does viscosity decrease with increasing temperature in a liquid?",
  "answer": "Viscosity, denoted by mu, varies strongly with temperature as it is closely linked to molecular motion. In a liquid molecules form bonds which enhances the transfer of momentum. As temperature rises, the kinetic energy of the molecules of the liquid increases. Thus, the particles move farther apart until bond forces no longer bind them together. Bond forces decrease and thus the transfer of momentum is reduced."

  "question": "What are the main assumptions associated with Fanno flow?",
  "answer": "Fanno flow is the adiabatic flow through a constant area duct where the effect of friction is considered. From this definition, we can identify that the main assumptions associated with Fanno flow are: the flow is steady, one-dimensional, and adiabatic through a constant-area duct, and the fluid is an ideal gas with constant specific heats.",

{
  "question": "Does the Mach number increase across an expansion fan? Why?",
  "answer": " Through an expansion fan, the Mach number increases, the static pressure decreases and the total pressure remains constant. This is because expansion fans are isentropic as a result of the area increase. Across an expansion fan, the velocity increases. Since Mach number can be determined by calculating velocity/area, this results in an increasing Mach number.",
