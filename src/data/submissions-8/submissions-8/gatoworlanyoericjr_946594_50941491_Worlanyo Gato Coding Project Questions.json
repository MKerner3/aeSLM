{
  "question": "What is the difference between gauge pressure and absolute pressure?",
  "answer": "Gauge pressure is the difference between the pressure you have and atmospheric pressure and absolute pressure is the total pressure you have."
}





{
  "question": "What is the difference between Cp and Cv and how do they change?",
  "answer": "Cp and Cv are specific heat constants under two different constraints. Cv is the specific heat constant under a constant volume, and Cp is the specific heat constant under constant pressure. The equations for Cv and Cp respectively are (du/dt)_v and (dh/dt)_p. When a gas is semi-perfect, Cp and Cv are functions of temperature, but when a  gas is perfect, Cp and Cv are constants.  "





{
  "question": "What is entropy?",
  "answer": "Entropy is an extensive property that defines the limit on extracting useful work from a system. It increases with irreversibility and increases in temperature."
}





{
  "question": "What can affect the energy of a system?",
  "answer": "Doing work on a system and adding heat to a system can raise the energy of that system. In addition, you can raise or lower the height, speed up or slow down the system, or change the enthalpy. You can see this in the steady flow momentum equation: (Qdot - Wx = E_cv + mdot_out(h_e + 1/2v_e^2 + gz_e) - 
mdot_in(h_i + 1/2v_i^2 + gz_i))"
}





{
  "question": "What is the difference between a control volume and a system boundary?",
  "answer": "Mass cannot cross a system boundary. Energy in the form of work or heat however can cross that boundary. The mass of the things in the boundary do not change but the size can change. In a control volume, the size is fixed but because of this, mass is permitted to cross its boundaries. A control volume can also move at a constant speed. "
}





{
  "question": "What is work and what does it represent?",
  "answer": "Work is a mode of transfering energy to a system from its surroundings. It can take many forms, such as magnetic, mechanical, or electric work. Mechanical work is when a system is moved by forces acting on the boundary. This work is very common."
}




{
  "question": "What makes a process reversible or irreversible?",
  "answer": "A process is reversible if the system and surroundings can be returned to the states they were originally at. All reversible processes are quasi-equilibrium processes meaning that they are done in very small steps and take place slowly. Some examples of irreversible processes are turbulence and heat transfer without a heat source. "
}





{
  "question": "What does Bernoulli's equation represent and when can it not be used?",
  "answer": "Bernoulli's equation gives the pressure change along a streamline in terms of height change and velocity change. This is only valid along streamlines and it cannot be used when the flow is compressiple, viscid or unsteady."
}





{
  "question": "How does friction change the velocity profile in a pipe?",
  "answer": "Friction causes the speed profile to reflect a parabola where the center of the pipe has the greatest speed and the ends are lower. This is termed a favorable profile."
}





{
  "question": "What is the difference between Couette flow and Pouseille flow and what happens when they are combined?",
  "answer": "Couette flow is a type of viscous flow where one plate is moving an another is stationary. In that case, the flow moves at the speed of the moving plate near it and the flow is near zero at the stationary plate. On the contrary Pouseille flow is flow where both plates are stationary. This results in a parabolic flow where speed is maximum halfway between both plates. When they are combined, you can have an adverse or favorable pressure gradient. Favorable flow happens when dp/dx is less than zero so as you move from one side to the next pressure drops. This velocity profile has a direction of the moving plate. An adverse pressure gradient happens when dp/dx is greater than 0 so pressure increases as you move from one side to another. That results in a velocity profile generally pointing in the opposite side of the plate movement. "
