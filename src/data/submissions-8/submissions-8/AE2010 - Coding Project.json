    "question": "What is the difference between the Newtons and Eulerian representations of the material derivative? How is this difference exhibited in their respective formulas?",
    "answer": {
        "explanation":"The material derivative is a derivative that describes the time rate of change of a fluid parcel quantity. This quantity is observed by an observer moving with the fluid, along the path line. 
  
  The Newtonian representation of the material derivative follows the motion of individual fluid particles. These individual particles have properties that are tracked as they move through time and space. It is expressed as
  
  D/Dt = ∂/∂t + u * ∇
  u is the velocity vector
  ∇ is the spatial gradient operator
  
  The Eulerian representation of the material derivative is based on a fixed frame of reference. It describes the rate of change of fluid properties at fixed points in space. This occurs as a fluid flows through and past points. It is expressed as:
  
  ∂/∂t + u · ∇
  
  The difference between the two is the frame of reference. The Newtonian representation follows individual fluid blobs, while the Eulerian representation examines fixed locations. The Newtonian representation is best for tracking trajectories, while the Eulerian representation is best for analyzing flows of fixed geometries.

    "question": "What are the key differences between Poiseuille flow and Couette flow? What are the practical applications of each type of flow?",
    "answer": {
        "explanation":"Poiseuille flow refers to the pressure-driven flow of a viscous fluid through a pipe with constant cross-section. The velocity profile of Poiseuille flow is parabolic, with the maximum velocity occurring at the centerline, and the minimum velocity (0 velocity) occurring alongside walls. This is a result of the new slip condition. It is important to note that the walls are stationary. Poiseuille is commonly seen in blood flow in vessels.
  
  Couette flow refers to the pressure-driven flow of a fluid, where one plate is stationary and the other is moving at constant velocity. The velocity profile of Couette flow is linear, with the maximum velocity occurring alongside the moving plate, and minimum velocity (0 velocity) occurring alongside the stationary plate. Couette flow is seen in the wind-driven flow in a body of water.
  
  It is important to note that Couette and Poiseuille flow can be combined to either form a favorable pressure gradient or an adverse pressure gradient.

    "question": "For incompressible flow, how does the advection operator explain the transport of a scalar quantity by the vector field? Explain the governing equations.",
    "answer": "The advection operator (u ⋅ ∇) represents the rate of change of a scalar quantity due to transport by the vector field in incompressible flow. Specifically, it represents the rate of change of height (based on the topology of the field) given velocity. This value is given as (v ⋅ ∇) h or v⋅ (∇h). Both of these values are equivalent, but the former is the more widely used. The operator can be expanded to vx(∂( )/∂x) + vy(∂( )/∂y) + vz(∂( )/∂z) in three dimensions of v. The advection operator accounts for the spatial variation of the scalar quantity as it undergoes the flow. Physically, the operator describes how the scalar quantity is swept along by the fluid motion."

{
    "question": "For incompressible flow. What is divergence and what is the physical significance of the divergence of the velocity field?",
    "answer": "The divergence of the velocity field (∇ · v) produces a scalar field equal to the net flux of the field out of each point in space. The net flux is the total amount of something flowing out of a closed surface. Simply, the divergence determines the direction a vector field is flowing. If (∇ · v) > 0, the vector field is flowing outwards. If (∇ · v) < 0 it is flowing inward. If the divergence is 0, it signifies that there is no net flow at that point. In other words, the amount flowing in is the same as the amount flowing out. Although written similarly to the advection operator, divergence holds a distinctively different meaning. Expanded, it can be written as (∂(vx)/∂x) + (∂(vy)/∂y) + (∂(vz)/∂z) in three dimensions of v."

    "question": "What are the differences between hydrostatic pressure, static pressure, stagnation pressure, and dynamic pressure? What are their governing equations?",
    "answer": {
        "explanation":"Hydrostatic pressure (Ph) is the pressure exerted on a fluid blob due to gravity. It is represented by ρgh or density*acceleration due to gravity*height.
  
  Stagnation pressure (p0) is the pressure that would be obtained if a flow were brought to rest without any loss of mechanical energy (and occurring isentropically). Measured using a Pitot tube, stagnation pressure represents the total pressure energy of the flow, which includes both static and dynamic pressure components.
  
  Static pressure (P) is the pressure a fluid exerts at rest or the pressure experienced by a fluid element as it moves along a streamline at the local flow velocity. It represents the purely random motion of the molecules in the flow and acts perpendicular to the flow direction. In other words, static pressure is the pressure that would be measured by a pressure gauge moving with the fluid flow.
  
  Dynamic pressure is the difference between stagnation and static pressure. It represents the pressure resulting from the kinetic energy of the fluid flow. It is represented by  ½ ρV2.
  
  The following equation can be used to combine static, dynamic, and stagnation pressure.
  P + ½ ρv² = P₀ 
  (static pressure + dynamic pressure = stagnation pressure)
  
  Bernoulli's equation can be used to show the relationship between 
  P + ½ ρv² + ρgh = C
  (static pressure + dynamic pressure + hydrostatic pressure = constant)

    "question": "How does the concept of entropy generation relate to irreversibilities present in thermodynamics processes? What are some practical implications?",
    "answer": {
        "explanation": "Entropy is the measure of molecular disorder or randomness in a system. It is the unavailability of a system’s energy to perform useful work. The second law of thermodynamics asserts that the change in entropy in an isolated system cannot be less than 0. This increase in entropy is a result of irreversibilities, which are less-than-ideal behaviors arising from various sources. This includes heat transfer across finite temperature differences, friction, viscosity, and other processes.
  
  The practical implications of entropy and irreversibilities are extraordinary. Specifically, for thermal management systems, such as HVAC, and industrial processes, irreversibilities can create temperature control challenges. Irreversibilities can cause issues such as heat dissipation and thermal pollution. Minimizing entropy, through optimizing heart transfer, and reducing friction, can thus be critical for maintaining energy efficiency, and optimizing environmental sustainability. This is evident in a company such as Coolbrook.

    "question": "What is the Zeroth law of thermodynamics and what justifies its crucial inclusion into the framework of thermodynamics alongside other laws?",
    "answer": {
        "explanation":"The zeroth law is fundamental in governing the behavior of heat and temperature. The law provides an independent definition of temperature which is distinct from the concept of entropy in the second law. The Zeroth law asserts that if two thermodynamic systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. Bodies in thermal equilibrium must have the same common property, which is defined as temperature. 
  
  Historically, the zeroth law was a necessary fundamental assertion because the first, second, and third laws had already been widely recognized. However, there was a crucial gap in the first three laws: temperature lacked an independent definition. The Zeroth law established a consistent framework for understanding heat transfer by explicitly defining temperature and thermal equilibrium. Without it, the “collapse of thermodynamics” would result.

    "question": "Why can the principles of continuity, momentum (Euler), and energy be used to form the normal shock relations when shocks appear to be discontinuous in these principles?",
    "answer": {
        "explanation":"The principles of continuity, momentum (Euler), and energy can still be used to derive normal shock relations because a normal shock can be seen as an infinitesimally thin region across which the flow properties change abruptly. The continuity principle ensures that mass is conserved across a shock. The flow rate into the control volume must be equal to the flow rate out. The momentum principle accounts for the conservation of momentum in the flow. The momentum flux must be conserved across a shock. The energy is conserved as no heat is added and there is no work done by the shock. Thus, the total enthalpy and total temperature remain constant. Essentially, what enters the shock surface in the front must come out in the back. However, because the flow is non-isentropic, the stagnation pressure downstream of the shock is always greater than the stagnation pressure upstream. The change in entropy is related to the ratio of total pressures.
  
  With regards to the normal show relations, the principles do not imply that the flow is isentropic. In the derivation, one can simply swap density and velocity, with gamma and mach number. When the flow is compressible, it is advantageous to swap density and velocity with gamma and mach, allowing for normal shock relations to be derived.

    "answer": {
        "explanation":"A detached shock forms when the supersonic flow encounters an object at a high angle of attack, resulting in flow separating from the body’ surface. The detached shock forms upstream of the object, creating a curved wave that is detached from the surface. In contrast, an attached shock forms when the object has a lower angle of attack, or is more streamlined, allowing the flow to remain attached to the surface, creating an oblique shock. A detached shock leads to a region of subsonic flow between the shock and the body, creating higher drag and flow disturbances compared to an attached shock.",
