   "" "question": "Define the difference between stagnation and static pressure and explain how they differ across a shock and across an expansion fan",
    "answer": "Stagnation pressure is the total pressure of a fluid, consisting of both its static and dynamic components. Across a shock wave, there is an instantaneous increase in static pressure, but a decrease in stagnation pressure. This decrease occurs because some of the fluid's kinetic energy is converted into pressure, leading to a reduction in stagnation pressure. Across an expansion fan, stagnation pressure remains constant, while static pressure decreases due to fluid expansion."

    "question": "What causes flow separation on an airfoil, where does it occur, and what are the negative effects that are caused by it?",
    "answer": "Flow separation on an airfoil occurs when airflow detaches from its surface, typically near the trailing edge at high angles of attack. This leads to decreased lift, increased drag, and loss of control, negatively affecting an aircraft's performance, stability, and efficiency."

    "question": "Describe why/how you would apply the Navier-Stokes equation to model the fluid flow through a pipe, taking into account the changes in diameter and the possible changes in flow velocity and pressure.",
    "answer": "We apply the Navier-Stokes equation to understand how fluid velocity and pressure change in response to varying pipe diameters. By defining the problem's geometry and boundary conditions, and using numerical methods to solve the equation, we gain insights into flow behavior. This approach helps optimize systems by predicting how fluids adapt to different pipe sections."

    "question": "When does momentum transport within a flow field occur and how can viscosity be connected to this concept?",
    "answer": "Momentum transport occurs in a fluid when fast-moving fluid parcels interact with slower ones, leading to the transfer of momentum. Viscosity, a measure of a fluid's resistance to flow, plays a crucial role in this process by determining the rate at which momentum is transferred through the fluid."

    "question": "What are the side-effects of an object moving through a fluid at supersonic speed? Explain how the flow field is affected, particularly considering changes in pressure and temperature.",
    "answer": "When an object moves through a fluid at supersonic speed, it generates a shock wave known as a bow shock. This results in a sudden increase in pressure and temperature upstream of the shock, accompanied by significant flow deflection around the object. These effects alter the flow field, leading to a gradual decrease in pressure and temperature rise downstream of the shock."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between a strong and weak oblique shock? Which one are you more likely to see in supersonic flow and why?",
    "answer": "A strong oblique shock has a higher deflection angle and occurs at higher Mach numbers, while a weak oblique shock has a smaller deflection angle and forms at lower Mach numbers. In supersonic flow, you are more likely to encounter weak oblique shocks because they require lower Mach numbers, which are more common in practical scenarios."

  {
    "question": "What does a vertical shift in one of the curves on the T-S graph represent?",
    "answer": "A vertical shift in a curve on a T-S (temperature-entropy) diagram indicates a change in specific volume while entropy remains constant. This shift typically occurs during processes like phase changes or reversible adiabatic processes where there's no heat exchange with the surroundings."

    "question": "You are at the CRC’s aquatic center conducting experiments for AE 2010. One such experiment you place a tube in the pool. The pressure on the outside of the pool is standard atmospheric pressure, and on the inside, you create a vacuum. Will the water level rise or fall and by how much?",
    "answer": "The water level will rise due to the vacuum conditions created in the tube. The water in the tube will rise until the pressure inside the tube is equal to the pressure outside the tube."

    "question": "There is a body of water at an unknown temperature. Two blocks of different temperatures are placed in the body, and both come into thermal equilibrium with the body of water separately from each other. Are we able to figure out whether or not the two blocks are in equilibrium with each other? If so, how?",
    "answer": "According to the 'Zeroth Law' of thermodynamics, if two systems are individually in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other."
