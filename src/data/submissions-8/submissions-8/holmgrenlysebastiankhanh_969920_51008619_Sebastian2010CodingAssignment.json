        "question": "A fluid with a density of 1000 kg/m^3 enters a pipe with a cross-sectional area of 0.1 m^2 at a velocity of 2 m/s. The pipe narrows to an area of 0.05 m^2. What is the fluid's velocity at the narrower section?",
        "answer": {
            "code": "\n        import numpy as np\n        rho = 1000\nA1 = 0.1\n        v1 = 2\nA2 = 0.05\n        v2 = (A1 * v1) / A2\n        print('Velocity in the narrower section:', v2, 'm/s')",
            "explanation": "This code utilizes the principle of continuity for incompressible flow, which states that the mass flow rate remains constant. The equation A1*v1 = A2*v2 expresses this, where A represents cross-sectional area and v represents velocity."

        "question": "Explain the difference between laminar and turbulent flow.",
        "answer": "Laminar flow is characterized by smooth, orderly movement of fluid particles in parallel layers, while turbulent flow is chaotic and characterized by irregular fluctuations in velocity and pressure. Reynolds number is used to determine flow regime, with laminar flow occurring at low Reynolds numbers and turbulent flow at high Reynolds numbers."

            "explanation": "The Mach number (M) is the ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound in the medium through which the object is moving. It indicates how fast an object moves compared to the speed of sound. The formula to calculate Mach number is M = v / a, where v is the speed of the object and a is the speed of sound in the medium."

        "question": "What is Bernoulli's principle and how does it apply to fluid dynamics?",
        "answer": "Bernoulli's principle states that in a fluid flow, an increase in the speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or potential energy. This principle is derived from the conservation of energy in fluid flow and is commonly used to explain phenomena such as lift in aerodynamics and the functioning of carburetors and atomizers."

        "question": "What is the difference between specific heat capacity and latent heat?",
        "answer": "Specific heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of a substance by one degree Celsius, while latent heat is the heat absorbed or released by a substance during a phase change (e.g., melting, vaporization) at constant temperature. Specific heat capacity is associated with temperature changes, while latent heat is associated with phase changes."

        "question": "Explain the difference between entropy and enthalpy.",
        "answer": "Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system, while enthalpy is a measure of the total energy of a system. Entropy increases in irreversible processes, indicating an increase in disorder, while enthalpy change is related to heat exchange in a system at constant pressure."

        "question": "What is the significance of the Mach number in compressible flow?",
        "answer": "The Mach number is a dimensionless quantity that represents the ratio of the speed of an object (or fluid) to the speed of sound in the surrounding medium. In compressible flow, the Mach number indicates whether the flow is subsonic (M < 1), sonic (M = 1), or supersonic (M > 1). It is crucial in determining the compressibility effects and shock wave formations in high-speed flows."

        "question": "What are the primary differences between adiabatic and isothermal processes?",
        "answer": "Adiabatic processes involve no heat exchange with the surroundings, resulting in changes in temperature without heat transfer. Isothermal processes occur at constant temperature, with heat exchange occurring to maintain the temperature constant. Adiabatic processes are typically faster than isothermal processes and can result in greater changes in temperature and pressure."

        "question": "Explain how a converging-diverging nozzle works in the context of compressible flow.",
        "answer": "A converging-diverging nozzle is used to accelerate the flow of a compressible fluid (such as a gas) to supersonic speeds. It consists of a converging section followed by a diverging section. In the converging section, the flow accelerates due to decreasing cross-sectional area, reaching sonic conditions at the throat. In the diverging section, the flow expands further, reaching supersonic speeds. This nozzle design is essential for applications such as rocket propulsion and supersonic wind tunnels."

        "question": "What is the significance of the critical Mach number in aerodynamics?",
        "answer": "The critical Mach number is the speed at which airflow over a body first reaches the speed of sound (Mach 1) at any point. It is a critical parameter in aerodynamics because airflow behavior changes significantly as the critical Mach number is approached and exceeded. At speeds above the critical Mach number, shock waves form and flow becomes supersonic, leading to aerodynamic effects such as wave drag and compressibility drag."
