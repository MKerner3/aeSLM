    "question": "Can you explain what exactly the Magnus effect is?",
    "answer": "A phenomenon associated with a spinning object moving through a fluid. Life forces act on the spinning object. The easiest example of the Magnus effect in real life is a soccer ball being kicked, and the lift generated on it."
},
{
    "question": "Assuming incompressible fluid, what can you interpret Bernoulli's equation to be an approximation of?",
    "answer": "The conservation of momentum"
},
{
    "question": "When Observing curved streamlines, how would you expect the pressure and velocities to act inside the curve? How about outside the curve?",
    "answer": "Low pressure and high velocity on the inside, high pressure and low velocity on the outside"
},
{
    "question": "How do you describe a reversible process in thermodynamics? Can you give three examples?",
    "answer": "A reversible process is a process in which any action done by the system can be undone. Three examples are: Compressing a gas, rotating magnetic fields, and a Carnot Engine Cycle."
},
{
    "question": " What are the three primary systems in thermodynamics, and what do they each mean?",
    "answer": "Isolated systems, closed systems, and open systems. Isolated system: mass nor energy can pass, and no external factors can ever affect it. Closed system: a closed system can exchange only energy with its surroundings, not matter. Open system: an open system can exchange both energy and matter with its surroundings"
},
{
    "question": "What are examples of things that affect the value of Sdot_irrev?",
    "answer": "Changes in entropy production due to irreversibilities. This includes viscous dissipation and internal heat transfer across finite temperature differences for example. Does not occur in reversible processes"
},
{
    "question": "What three equations are used to derive the relationship between M2 and M1 for normal shocks? How do you combine these three equations to arrive at this derivation?",
    "answer": "The conservation of mass: rho_1*V_1 = rho_2*V_2; Conservation of momentum: P1 + rho_1*V_1^2 = P2 + rho_2*V_2^2; Conservation of energy h1 + .5V_1^2 = h2 + .5V_2^2. Get them in isentropic form and then multiply continuity of mass and energy, and divide by momentum."
},
{
    "question": "What does flow across a concave corner create? What about a convex corner?",
    "answer": "An oblique shock across the corner. A convex corner creates an expansion fan across the corner."
},
{
    "question": "What is the deflection angle of an oblique shock? At what value is this angle at a maximum?",
    "answer ": "The deflection angle is what describes how the shock is oriented. This angle is at a maximum at 0 degrees, as it increases the more it approaches 90 degrees, or a normal shock."
