        "question": "If heat is added to a closed system while no work is done and no heat is transferred out, what happens according to the first law of thermodynamics?",

        "question": "When we talk about pressure in fluid mechanics, what's the difference between stagnation pressure and static pressure?",
        "answer": "Stagnation pressure is the total energy the fluid has considering both its resting pressure and the pressure it gains from its movement, while static pressure just looks at the pressure from the fluid sitting still."
