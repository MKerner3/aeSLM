Describe what happens to the pressure and internal energy of the system, and if heat is added or removed to the system.",
        "answer": "Since the process occurs at constant temperature, we can conclude that the gas undergoes an isothermal process. In an isothermal process, the internal energy of the gas remains constant (delta U = 0) because the temperature does not change. This implies that the heat added to the gas (Q) is equal to the work done by the gas (W). In an expansion process, the work done by the gas is negative (W < 0) because the gas is doing work on the surroundings. Therefore, the heat added to the gas is negative as well, meaning heat is removed from the gas. As a result, the pressure of the system decreases as the gas expands and the volume increases."

Stagnation pressure is the pressure that would be measured by a pitot tube facing directly into the flow, where the fluid is brought to zero speed by a steady isentropic process with no external work done. Static pressure is the pressure exerted by a fluid on a surface when the fluid is not in motion relative to the surface. Dynamic pressure is the pressure difference between the stagnation pressure and the static pressure, and it is the pressure that is used to calculate airspeed."

        "answer": "The Magnus effect is a phenomenon where a spinning object experiences a sideways force perpendicular to both the direction of the fluid flow and the axis of rotation. The rotation of the object creates a difference in velocity between the fluid on one side of the object and the fluid on the other side. The fluid on the side moving in the same direction as the spin travels faster relative to the object, while the fluid on the opposite side moves slower. This velocity difference results in a pressure difference between the two sides of the object, and hence a sideways force."

        "question": "What is the coanda effect?",
        "answer": "The Coanda effect describes the tendency of a fluid jet to adhere to and flow along a nearby surface, rather than detaching and flowing freely. When a fluid flows over a surface, it creates a thin layer of slow-moving fluid molecules close to the surface called the boundary layer. The boundary layer has lower velocity due to friction and lower pressure compared to the faster-moving fluid outside the boundary layer. As a result, the higher-pressure fluid outside the boundary layer pushes the jet towards the surface, causing it to adhere to and follow the contour of the surface."

        "question": "What are the assumptions made in using Bernoulli's equation?",
        "answer": "To apply Bernoulli's equation, the flow must be steady, incompressible, and inviscid (no friction by viscous forces). While no flow is really incompressible, flows with M<0.3 can be treated as incompressible, as the end result is usually within 5% compared to treating the M<0.3 flow as compressible."

        "question": "What happens to a shock wave when a supersonic stream encounters a physical object with an angle greater than the maximum deflection angle?",
        "answer": "If the phsyical geometry is such that the angle is greater than the maximum deflection angle, then no solution exists for a straight oblique shock wave. Instead, nature establishes a curved shock wave, detached from the corner or the nose of a body. This is also what causes a bow-wave to be observed in front of pitot-tubes in certain conditions."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why are expansion fans considered isentropic?",
        "answer": "Expansion fans typically occur adiabatically, meaning there is no heat transfer between the fluid and its surroundings during the expansion. There is usually no external work being done on or by the fluid. The expansion occurs due to a decrease in pressure or an increase in volume without any external force acting on the fluid. Without external work being done, the energy of the fluid remains constant, preserving the isentropic condition when we assume they are frictionless and reversible. "
