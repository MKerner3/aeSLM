        "answer" : "Poiseulle flow is characterized by a constant pressure gradient causing the laminar flow of an incompressible fluid moving between two fixed plates (such as a pipe). Couette flow, however, involves one stagnant plate and one moving plate that drives the flow of the fluid through shear stress, rather than a pressure gradient.",

        "answer" : "An adiabatic process refers to that fact that there is no heat exchange between the system and its surroundings. However, a temperature change within the system itself is allowed. In other words, the temperature can be altered by work, but there is no exchange with the surroundings.",

        "question" : "How do you distinguish between a reversible and irreversible process?",
        "answer" : "A reversible process is a process where both the system and the surroundings can be returned to their initial states. This means that the net heat and net work exhchange between the system and the surroundings is zero. Irreversibilites are caused by factors such as friction, unrestrained expansion, and heat transfer across a finite temperature difference.",

        "answer" : "The cyclic integral of SQ/T is always less than or equal to zero. This is valid for reversible and irreversible cycles. If a cycle is reversible, the integral will be equal to zero. The Kelvin-Plank statement tells us that no system can produce a net amount of work while operating in a cycle and exchanging heat with a single thermal energy reservoir. Due to this statement, we know that the total work of the system cannot be greater than 0. However it can be less than 0, allowing us to utilize the Clausius Inequality for irreversible processes.",

Therefore, many control volumes acting in steady flow processes experience no change in their entropy. This makes it possible to use isentropic relations, and assume constant conditions through the control volume.",

If net work is the same for all adiabatic processes of a closed system between two defined states, then the value of the net work must depend soley on the end states of the system, which corresponds to a change in property called total energy.
