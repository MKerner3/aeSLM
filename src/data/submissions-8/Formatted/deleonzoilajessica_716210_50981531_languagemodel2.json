        "answer": "A system refers to a fixed mass with a boundary. However, with time the boundary of the system may change, but the mass remains the same. Instead of focusing on a fixed mass, we can observe the flow through a window, this window is called a control volume.",

        "answer": "In steady flow, the conditions (such as velocity, pressure, and cross-section) can vary from point to point within the fluid, but they do not change over time. While in unsteady flow the fluid conditions change with time, for example water distribution systems during valve opening or closing.",

        "question": "What is the change in entropy in an adiabatic process? Does this imply that adiabatic processes are reversible?",
        "answer": "An adiabatic process occurs without transferring heat or mass between the system and its environment and only transfers energy as work. In a reversible adiabatic process, the entropy change is zero but in an irreversible adiabatic process the entropy increases. So, this does not necessarily imply reversibility.",

        "answer": "A is a reversible process because when you go into a pool slowly the water level rises slowly and maintains equilibrium and if you slowly get out the pool water will go back to normal. B is irreversible because by jumping into a pool, the water experiences sudden turbulence and waves cannot be reversed. C is reversible since balloons typically deflate slowly and unless the plastic is overly stretched, inflating a balloon would put it back to its original state.",

        "question": "A real process may be nearly adiabatic if it occurs over a very short time. How does the short time span help the process to be adiabatic?",
        "answer": "The short time span helps the process because the heat does not take enough time to enter the system and the transmission of heat from the surroundings takes time, so if the changes of the system occur suddenly, then there may not be enough time for the transmission of heat.",

        "answer": "Shock waves happen when an object moves faster than the speed of sound so, there cannot be any usual reactions to variations in pressure and density which causes pressure builds up rapidly causing a wave. Now, incompressible flows are isochoric meaning that volume does not change and are characterized by having negligible changes in density.

        "question": "What are the basic components of a supersonic wind tunnel and what do they do?",
        "answer": "The basic components of a supersonic wind tunnel are the nozzle, the testing or working station, the diffuser, the compressor, and a heat exchanger. The way the nozzle is shaped determines the Mach number and accelerates the air to supersonic speeds. Then the supersonic airflow goes to the working or testing station, which is where aircraft or airfoils are to be placed so the aerodynamic effects can be observed. Leaving the test section, the diffuser is where the airflow slows down and the air finally exits the wind tunnel having had pressure and velocity reduced. Due to the shock loss, air experiences a loss of stagnation pressure, the compressor helps restore that with a byproduct of increasing the temperature so there is also a heat exchanger to cool it.",
