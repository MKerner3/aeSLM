      "answer": "The Magnus Effect is taking place here, which demonstrates that when a ball is rotating through a fluid, there is an lift force created on it due to the forces of friction allowing air to stick to the ball, deflecting the air upwards as the ball is spinning backwards.",

      "answer": "In thermodynamics, heat refers to the transfer of thermal energy from a hotter system to a cooler temperature, while temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy of all the molecules in a system. Enthalpy simply measures the amount of heat that flows between a system and its surroundings, therefore at a constant pressure, enthalpy and heat are the same value.",

      "answer": "The property being described is called viscocity and it measures the fluids resistance to flow. This resistance is a result of internal friction between molecules which is related to the molecular structure of the fluid. Thus honey has more internal friction that water due to its molecular composition.",

The reynolds number quantifies this by using a nondimensional expression, where a low value represents laminar flow and a high value represents turbulant flow.",

If the diaphram broke, describe what would happen to the pressure, volume, and temperature. Additionally, state whether this process is reversible or irreversible and why.",
      "answer": "If the diaphram broke, pressure would decrease, volume would increase and temperature would remain constant. Pressure decreaased and volume increased due to the ideal gas relations. Temperature is constant because there is no heat being added to the system and no work is being done because there must be resistance for work to occur. Therefore, according to the first law of thermodynamics (U = Q + W), dU = 0, thus dT = 0. Additionally, this process is considered irreversible, because it will require work to bring the system back to its original state.",

      "answer": "Yes, an isentropic process must be adiabatic and reversible, neither of which depend on whether the system is isothermal. For example, a gas expanding at a constant temperature would be isothermal, but entropy would still increase since molecules are able to move around in more places with a constant kinetic energy",

      "question": "When watching a tank pressurization sequence, you notice that the pressure rise over time is in exponential decay, even though the valve is a simple ball valve that is either fully open or closed. Why does this happen?",
      "answer": "When the valve first opens and the tank is empty, there is a large pressure difference between the pressure reservoir and the tanks, however, as the tank becomes more and more full, the pressure difference decreases. The fluid particles are going to diffuse quicker when there is a large pressure drop, thus creating a funciton with a large initial slope that tapers off as the tank fills up further. This can also be though of in terms of pressure = force x area, thus more pressure difference means more force, which means more acceleration of fluid particles according to Newtons second law.",

The Eulerian frame of reference is also comomonly used and sets up a system boundary and deals with a system of particles moving through the boundary.",
