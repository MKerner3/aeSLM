    "question": "Why does Cp equal Cv for incompressible fluids?",
    "answer": "We know that under incompressible fluids that density does not change and stays constant under changes in pressure. In other words, this means that the volume does not change and dv=0. With the first law, we know U = pdV + Q, but dv=0, so U=Q=mCdeltaT where C is the specific heat of the substance and m is the mass. Essentially, all the heat added to the substance results in an increase in temperature disregarding pressure or volume, so there is no distinction between Cp and Cv for incompressible fluids. For this explanation, Cv and Cp are essentially constants because there are no changes in density with incompressible fluids. Since there are no significant changes in volume during the process, then we know that Cp and Cv are a function of temperature only and can be recognized as C.",

    "answer": "A process is reversible if it can be turned back into its original state through the same process just reversed. A reversible process is what we associate isentropic processes with along with it being adiabtic. If something is reversible and adiabatic, then it is reversible, but just because it's reversible, does not guaratee it is isentropic. An irreversible process cannot be turned back into it's original state and there is also an increase in entropy or disorder of the system. An irreversible process is considered this way because it cannot be undone without using energy. a. reversible b. irreversible c. irreversible d. irrerversible e. irrerversible",

    "question":"Explain what happens when a speed is subsonic (M<1) and the area increases, and then what happens when a speed is supersonic (M>1) and the area increases. Do the same for both subsonic and supersonic, but the area decreases. Which is intuitive and which is not?",
    "answer": "A subonic speed means that it is below Mach 1. If the area is increasing then the pressure will increase, while the velocity will decrease. When the speed is supersonic, the explanation is less intuitive. The velocity will increase, while the pressure decreases. This is with a converging nozzle or diffuser. The opposite occurs for decreasing area. With subsonic speeds, the pressure will decrease, while the velocity increases, which is in line with what we know already. But for supersonic speeds, the pressure increases, while the velocity decreases. Subsonic speeds are more intuitive because it goes along with incompressible fluids, while supersonic speeds do the opposite. We can see why they behave this way because of the variable nozzle flow equation.",

    "question": "What is the difference between a concave corner and convex corner, and what does each produce?",
    "answer": "When dealing with a concave corner, you will generate an oblique shock. A concave corner will produce one single shock at a specific angle given in a problem. This type of shock behaves just as a normal shock does. After the shock, the Mach number is smaller, static density, pressure, and enthalpy all increase, while stagnation pressure decreases. As for a convex corner, this generates an expansion fan. Expansion fans behave completely opposite as oblique shocks do, except that the stagnation pressure stays constant throughout the shock because they are isentropic. Many equations can be derived from using these relations.",

    "question":"What exactly is enthalpy and give an example of its use along with an equation to represent it?",
    "answer": "Enthalpy is the measure of energy in a thermodynamic system; it is the heat absorbed or released in a process at constant temperature. It is the total sum of internal energy plus pressure times velocity. Enthalpy is also known as a state function which means it only cares about the final state of the system. Enthalpy mainly cares about what current state you are in at the moment. It is useful in situations where there is constant external pressure meaning that enthalpy will be equal to energy exchanged by the environment with heat. Enthalpy can be used to improve thermal systems and maximize efficiency. A good formula is H = U + pV.",

    "question":"What is the difference between heat and temperature and give an example of each?",
    "answer": "Heat is all about the thermal energy that is transferred from one system to the next, while temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of molecules in a system. We are able to actually calculate the amount of heat absorbed or released by using the specific heat capcity, mass, and temperature change. An example would be looking at the heat exchange between a hot block and a cold block, then stating the temperature of each. Heat is more spoken about as a process and not a state. Temperature is more of a state function which comes from the zeroth law. The zeroth law states that when two objects in thermal equlibrium are in contact, there is no heat transfer and we call them the same temperature. It also states that heat flows from one source to another only if there is a difference between the two which is temperature. Anytime you use a thermometer, you are using the zeroth law.",

    "question": "How is Bernoulli's equation related to the conservation of energy, and what do each of the terms mean?",
    "answer": "Bernoulli's equation basically expresses the conservation of enegery for flowing fluids. Bernoulli's equation is representing the flow of something in terms of pressure, velocity, and height. It includes both kinetic and potential energy plus pressure. The sum of these values will remain constant along a streamline that is not curved. The conservation of energy states that energy within a closed system is constant. Going along with Bernoulli's terms, the kinetic energy term shows the energy with fluid motion, the potential energy term shows energy due to a fluids height, while the pressure term reflects the energy stored internally. Bernoulli's equation is a convienent way to express the conservation of energy for incompressible fluids.",

    "question": "In what ways does the concept of enthalpy impact the design of heat exchangers?",
    "answer": "From before, we know that enthalpy can have a huge effect on the efficiency and effectiveness of heat exchangers. When thinking about designing a heat exchanger, you must think about the enthalpy changes to ensure you get the desired temperature change. You would need to consider the first two laws of thermodynamics in order to be most precise. When thinking about the first law, you could calculate the amount of heat that needs to be transferred which makes you think about the size of the heat exchanger. When thinking about second law, this shows us the direction of flow and efficiency. In order to produce the best heat exchanger, you would need to know how to maximize the energy using the concept of enthalpy. By carefully measuring the changes in enthalpy, you can find the system that works the best while staying in thermodynamic limits.",

    "question":"How would you differentiate between isothermal and adiabatic processes regarding the amount of work done?",
    "answer": "First, it would be good to define an isothermal process. An isothermal process is when the temperture remains constant and the amount of work done is equal to the amount of heat transferred, while an adiabatic process is when there is no heat transferred during the process. For an adiabatic process, any work done results in a change in the system's internal energy and change in temperature. We know that Q= 0 when some process is adiabatic and that a useful equation would be that internal energy is equal to the amount of work done. You can also distinguish between the two by knowing the equation for an isothermal process which will give you the amount of work done. This would be W=nRTln(Vf/Vi) where n is the number of moles, T is temperature, and R is the universal gas constant.",
