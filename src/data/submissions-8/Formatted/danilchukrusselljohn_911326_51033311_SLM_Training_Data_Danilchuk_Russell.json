    "question": "Define a fluid in relation to its ability to sustain shear stress.",
    "answer": "A fluid is a substance which cannot sustain shear stress when at rest. Shear stresses are sustained in fluids only when relative motion between fluid particles takes place. Another way to say this is that when a fluid is at rest, there are no shear stresses.",

{
    "question": "Describe how pressure acts upon a stationary object submerged in a fluid using the hydrostatic equation.",
    "answer": "A body immersed in a fluid will still experience a force even if there is no relative motion between the body and the fluid. Since no shear stresses are present in a stationary fluid, pressure is set by the normal component of force with respect to the surface. Considering the weight of the object and the hydrostatic equation dp = -g * rho * dy, we can say that pressure increases with depth and that the net force on the object acts only in the vertical direction. Archimedes Principle states that the upward force on the submerged body is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.",

{
    "question": "Define gauge pressure and its importance.",

{
    "question": "What is the physical significance of Bernoulli's Equation?",
    "answer": "When velocity increases, pressure decreases, and when velocity decreases, pressure increases. Bernoulli's equation is also a relation for mechanical energy in an incompressible flow as it states that the work done on a fluid by pressure forces is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the flow",

{
    "question": "What are Couette and Poiseuille Flows and what occurs when they are combined?",
    "answer": "Couette flow occurs between two parallel plates when one plate is stationary and the other moves at a constant velocity, creating a linear velocity profile between them. Poiseuille flow occurs in a fully enclosed pipe or between two stationary parallel plates driven by a pressure gradient. The velocity profile for Poiseuille flow is parabolic, with the maximum velocity occurring at the center of the pipe or midway between the plates and decreasing to zero at the walls. When these flows are combined, the force balance and equations of motion are the same but the boundary conditions are different. Either a favorable pressure gradient occurs (when dp/dx < 0) or and adverse pressure gradient occurs (when dp/dx > 0)",

{
    "question":"Explain the implications of an adiabatic process within the First Law of Thermodynamics",
    "answer":"The first law states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, meaning a state has a total energy, denoted as E. The energy of a system is the sum of kinetic energy, potential energy, and internal energies. Energy can be transferred as heat, work, or mass flow. An Adiabatic process involves no heat transfer. Assuming no kinetic or potential energy contributions, this means that the work done on or by a system during an adiabatic process is independant of the path taken.",

{
    "question":"What is a polytropic process and how does the value of the parameter n determine what type of process occurs?",
    "answer":"A polytropic process is a compression or expansion for which the pressure and volume are related by p*V^n = constant. The parameter n is assumed to remain constant throughout the process. For ideal gasses, n = gamma indicates an isentropic proccess, n = 1 represents an isothermal process, n = 0 is isobaric, n = infinity is isochoric, n between 1 and gamme usually indicates a process with heat transfer.",

    "question":"Elaborate on the clausius and kelvin-planck statements and how they limit the efficeincy of heat engines.",
    "answer":"The Kelvin-Planck statement states that it is impossible to build a cyclic device whose sole effect is to produce positve work while recieving heat from a single thermal reservoir, which is assumed to have infinite thermal heat capacity. This statement says that all the heat cannot be converted into useful work, there must be some limit on the efficiency. The clausius statement demonstrates the irriversibility of nature, stating that heat cannot be transferred from a colder body to a hotter one without an input of work. In summmary, these statements conclude that heat engines are limited in effieciency. The maximum efficiency of a cyclic heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs is attained when the cycle is reversible.",

{
    "question":"Explain why change in entropy is path independant and what the only way to reduce the entropy of a system is.",
    "answer":"Entropy is an extensive property representing the inability of a systems thermal energy to produce useful mechanical work. By the definition of a thermodynamic property, the value of entropy must depend only on the state of the system, not on the path taken. Entropy change is proportional to the mass of a system. Entropy can only be integrated over a reversible process. For irriversible processes, there is an infinitesimal entropy production due to the irreversability within the system, meaning the only way to reduce the entropy of a closed system is to give up heat to the surroundings.",
