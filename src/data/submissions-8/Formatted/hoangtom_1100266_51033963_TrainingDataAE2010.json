    "question": "What happens to stagnation pressure across an expansion fan and why, and how, does this differ from stagnation pressure ratios across an oblique shock?",
    "answer": "Across an expansion fan, stagnation pressure stays constant because entropy stays constant, meaning that the flow is isentropic. For a flow to be considered isentropic, the flow must be reversible and adiabatic. Since the flow turns in small angles and changes across each expansion wave are small, the flow can be considered to be in quasi-equilibrium, which means that the flow is adiabatic and reversible, thus isentropic. In an oblique shock however, stagnation pressure decreases across the shock as flow across any shock is non-isentropic, since many of the gas’ properties increase instantaneously during a shock.",

    "question": "Why does a violation of the Kelvin-Planck statement also violates the Clausius statement?",
    "answer": "The Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law of thermodynamics states that it is impossible to construct a cyclic device with the sole effect to produce positive work while receiving heat from a single thermal reservoir, or in other words all heat from a heat reservoir cannot be converted into useful work, meaning there is a max efficiency for said process. Whereas Clausius’ statement states it is impossible to create a cyclic device with the sole effect of transferring heat from a cooler to warmer body. While these two statements refer to different configurations of a cyclic device, the consequences of these statements are equivalent to each other due to the nature of heat engines and irreversibilities from heat transfer. One way to visualize this concurrent violation is consider a violation of the Kelvin-Planck statement, where a heat engine converts all heat into useful work. Now imagine connecting that useful work into a cyclic device, so that it is able to transfer heat from a cooler to warmer body. Since the work came from a device that violates the Kelvin-Planck statement, that cyclic device that transfers heat from cooler to hotter body would also be in violation. Thus, a violation of Kelvin-Planck also violates Clausius statement.",

    "question": "Why does Bernouli’s Principle only apply along streamlines, and not across streamlines?",
    "answer": "Bernoulli’s Principle expresses the pressure variation along streamlines as a function of velocity and height, and is valid for flows that are steady, incompressible, and inviscid. This principle is not valid across streamlines because of the velocity and pressure variations between the streamlines. Since Bernoulli’s assume the flow to be steady, or velocity is fixed, the velocity and pressure gradients across the streamlines makes Bernoulli’s invalid.",

    "question": "Can you elaborate on the two-property rule?",
    "answer": "The two-property rule states that within a system, two properties must be specified as independent to have the state fixed. In other words, it not possible to vary pressure, temperature, and volume independently at once, rather two of these three properties must be fixed, and the third property must be expressed as an equation of state of the two fixed properties. For example, if volume and pressure are fixed, and temperature needs to be determined, then temperature should be expressed as a function of volume and pressure.",

    "question": "How is a control volume different from a system boundary and why are control volumes important?",
    "answer": "System boundaries are often thought of as an imaginary boundary where mass cannot cross the boundary, while energy in the form of work or heat is able to cross. In a system boundary, the volume is not fixed, meaning that if the volume expands or shrinks, then the system boundary would be altered to accommodate the change. Control volumes are similar to a system boundary, but unlike a system boundary, the volume and shape stays fixed in a control volume. Furthermore, mass is permitted to cross its boundaries and since volume is fixed, mass flowing in must be equal to the mass flowing out. Control volumes are important when determining mass flows of inlets and outlets of various sections, since mass is conserved within the control volume, meaning that continuity is applied.",

{
    "question": "Why can’t the isentropic flow relations be applied across a shock?",
    "answer": "While a shock is adiabatic, since the gas’ properties increase instantaneously in a short period of time where there is no time for heat to be transferred, a shock is an irreversible process, since there is a loss in total press across the shock. This means that flow across a shock is non-isentropic as for flow to be considered as isentropic, the flow must be reversible and adiabatic.",

In addition, Fanno flow is an isothermal process (temperature is constant), whereas Rayleigh flow is an isentropic process (entropy is constant).",

    "question": "Why is only the change in entropy defined and not static entropy?",
    "answer": "Entropy is defined as a system’s inability to do useful work and is only defined as the change of entropy between two states because there is no method of measuring entropy at certain points of time. Since entropy is a state function, the change in entropy will be the same between two states no matter which path was taken to reach from state one to state two.",

{
    "question": "Why are conservation laws used to form the shock relations?",
    "answer": "Conservation laws are able to be utilized to form relations for different values across a shock because while the shock itself is not isentropic, flow before and after the shock are in isentropic flow. In addition, mass, momentum, and energy are all conserved throughout the flow before and after a shock since flow still follows the laws of physics. Knowing that conservation laws are valid for flow before and after the shock, relations can be built around the forming of ratios of certain properties of the gas (such as pressure, velocity, and temperature) before and after a shock to tell us how a shock impacts the properties of a gas, as a shock cuts of the line of communication between the entrance and exit of said shock.",
