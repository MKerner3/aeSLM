        "question": "What assumptions and principles underly Bernoulli's equation and how can it be used to determine gradients across curved streamlines?",

Once solved, Bernoulli's equation, p + 0.5 * rho * v^2 = c, is derived, which can generally only be used along streamlines. This equation shows there is an inverse relationship between pressure and velocity. Using Newton's second law again with curved streamlines, there is a pressure gradient along the streamlines with lower pressure being towards the center of the curvature. By using Bernoulli's equation, high pressures are related to low velocities so with a strong streamline curvature, one can expect high pressures and low velocities on the outside and low pressures, high velocities on the inside.",

In a favorable pressure gradient, pressure pushes the fluid in the direction of the moving plate. The velocity profile is parabolic with a steep gradient near the stationary plate. In an adverse pressure gradient, the pressure pushes in the opposite direction of the moving plate. The velocity profile is also parabolic, but it might reverse near the stationary plate.",

        "answer": "In reversible processes, there can not be any substantial deviations from equilibrium, hence it is a quasi-equilibrium process. This means that with pdV work, the pressure must be uniform throughout a cyclinder. Irreversible processes have non-uniformities in some properties, such as temperature decay through conduction. An example of a reversible process is a slow adiabatic compression/expansion of a gas in a cylinder. An irreversible process is such where two copper blocks with a finite temperature difference are brought into thermal contact. Heat transfer occurs from the hotter block to the colder block and once equilibrium is reached, spontaneous heat flow doesn't reverse.",

        "question": "Given the system a gas enclosed by a piston and insulating walls with a stirrer, how are adiabatically inaccessible states a consequence of the 2nd law of thermodynamics?",
        "answer": "It is to be noted that the system can only receive shaft work from the stirrer. If the piston is displaced slowly, the gas can be compressed/expanded along a quasi-equilibrium adiabatic curve on a pV graph. If a system starts below the curve, a combination of stirring and compressing/expanding can move its state to be on the curve. Once on the curve, work can not be extracted to go below the curve because you can not unstir the gas. The only way to go to a state that is below the curve would be by extracting heat to the surroundings, but since the gas is perfectly insulated, this is not possible. The idea of going from a state on the curve to below the curve adiabatically can not occur, making some states adiabatically inaccessible due to the second law.",

By substituting the definition of entropy and flow work (pdV work) into the first law, the first Tds equation is derived (Tds = dU + pdV). A second Tds equation is formed by using the definition of enthalpy (H = U + pV). When a small change in enthalpy occurs, one can solve for dU and subsitute it into the first Tds equation. With further simplifying, the second Tds equation becomes Tds = dH - Vdp. These Tds equations encompass the first and second laws of thermodynamics and are valid for simple compressible systems in the absence of capillarity, electric, and magnetic fields.",

The equation shows that when the Mach number is greater than 1 and the change in area is positive, hence a diverging nozzle, the change in velocity must be positive. Using the 1D Euler equation relating a change in velocity and change in pressure, with a positive change in velocity, the change in pressure must be decreasing.

It is considered an irreversible process since viscous friction acts as a shear stress on the walls of the pipe. The friction reduces the effective area of the pipe, and if the pipe is sufficiently long enough, the friction serves to choke the throat in the pipe. If the flow entering the pipe is subsonic, its velocity starts to rise to the choking condition. If the flow entering the pipe is supersonic, the velocity drops through the pipe until it is choked.",
