    "question": "A piston/cylinder system containing 1 kg of “laughing gas” (nitrous oxide, N2O), is initially at 298 K and 1.00 bar. The system then goes through a process where heat transfer adds 101 kJ to the gas, and simultaneously the piston is moved in such a way that the product of pressure and volume in the cylinder is unchanged – in other words pV is constant during the heat addition. After the process has ended, the pressure of the N2O in the cylinder is 0.130 bar. N2O has a molecular weight of 44. What is the entropy change of the gas due to this process?",
    "answer": "\nimport numpy as np\n\nR = 8314 / 44 #converting gas constant\nP2 = 0.13 #final pressure (bar)\nP1 = 1 #initial pressure (bar)\n\n#solve for entropy\ns = -R * (np.log(P2/P1))\n\n\nprint('Change in entropy:', s, 'J/kgK')\n        ",
    "explanation": "For an ideal gas, pV = mRT. Because pV is constant, then mRT is also constant, so T1 = T2. Then, use entropy change equation to solve for the change in entropy.",

    "answer": "It is important because it shows what happened in the process. A positive change in entropy means either entropy was produced or there was heat transfer to the system.
