    "answer": "First, given the parameters, assume the process is reversible. The efficiency of a heat engine is given by the ratio of the work output to the heat input. For reversible processes, we can write the efficiency,n, as n = 1 - Tc/Th, where Tc and Th are temperatures of the cold and hot reservoir respectively. As the temperature of the cold reservoir (Tc) is increased while keeping the temperature of the hot reservoir (Th) constant, the efficiency of the engine decreases. This is because the temperature difference (Th - Tc) decreases. ",

    "question": "How is choked flow achieved in a convergent nozzle and what are its implications?",
    "answer": "The fluid velocity can be manipulated by changing the exit static pressure. Choked flow occurs when the fluid reaches Mach 1 at the throat. To achieve Mach 1, the exit static pressure is decreased until the ratio of inlet stagnation pressure over exit static pressure reaches around 1.893. Once you hit Mach 1, flow velocity cannot increase further, even if the exit static pressure decreases. Therefore, the mass flow rate cannot increase and reaches its maximum.",

    "answer": "The increase in friction represents greater wall shear stress as given by the equation Cf = t/(1/2*rho*v^2) where t is the wall shear stress. As t increases, the pressure drop along a duct increases due to larger pressure losses given by dp/dx = -4t/D. As friction serves to reduce the effective area, the choked flow conditions will be reached at a shorter duct length.",

As temperature increases, the slope increases. For constant volume, the Tds equation is (dT/ds) = T/Cv. Since, Cv < Cp for a perfect gas, the constant volume line is steeper. An isentropic compression process is represented as a vertical line from a lower constant pressure line to a higher one. The opposite is true for an isentropic expansion process.",

If the piston is displaced slowly, the gas can be compressed/expanded along a quasi-equilibrium adiabatic curve on a pV graph.

Once on the curve, work can not be extracted to go below the curve because you can not unstir the gas. The only way to go to a state that is below the curve would be by extracting heat to the surroundings, but since the gas is perfectly insulated, this is not possible.

    "question": "What is the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics and why was it required to be established before the 1st-3rd Laws?",
    "answer": "If two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third body, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.\nHaving the zeroth law gives us a set definition and key property of temperature. It was named the zeroth law even though it was created after the first and second laws because the zeroth law provides necessary assumptions to apply the others.\nFor example, this established temperature as a property: bodies in thermal equilibrium have the same temperature. It also gave meaning to the Kelvin scale where it is measured from an absolute zero: where enthalpy and entropy are minimized.",

    "question": "What is an adiabatic process, and how can we distinguish if a process is adiabatic?",
    "answer": "An adiabatic process is one where no heat is transferred, often used in equations as Q = 0. In general, systems that are insulated can be assumed to be adiabatic. Processes that also occur quickly can be assumed to be adiabatic since there is no time for heat to be transferred.\nIf a system is adiabatic, we can make more assumptions if given other conditions. For example, adiabatic and reversible processes are also isentropic.",

    "question": "How can we compare the lift resulting from the Magnus effect to the lift generated in a standard airfoil?",
    "answer": "The Magnus Effect occurs when a spinning object travels through a fluid. The spin can generate a force that curves the object's trajectory. In the case of a cylinder rotating in a flow, this can generate lift.\nThis occurs because speaking in simple terms and Newton's Third Law, the spin pushs the air down which pushes the cylinder up. What's really happening when the air is 'pushed down' is that a pressure differential is created (high pressure under the cylinder, low above the cylinder) which generated lift.\nThis pressure differential is the same thing that causes lift in a standard airfoil, but instead of being generated by spin, an airfoil's lift is generated through its geometry.",

    "question": "What does the Del Operator represent and what are some of its applications in other equations?",
    "answer": "In the scope of this course, the del operator takes on 3 main roles calculating: gradient, divergence, and advection.\nFirstly, the del operator is defined as taking the partial derivative of the x-component with respect to x, the y-component with respect to y, and the z-component with respect to z.\nJust taking the del operator of a vector will give you the gradient which is also a vector. The gradient shows directions where the value increases.\nTaking the dot product of the del operator and a vector is called the divergence. The divergence (a scalar) tells you net flux of each point (how many vectors are pointing to this point in a way). If divergence is greater than zero then the point is a source. If less than zero, then the point is a sink. If it is zero then neither apply.\nTaking the dot product of velocity and the del operator of a value gives us advection which can be described as the rate of change of the value given the velocity. Advection is a scalar value.",

    "question": "What are the properties of a sound wave and why do they matter when considering compressible fluid mechanics?",
    "answer": "Sound waves are longitudinal waves as opposed to transverse waves. This means in a sound wave there are regions of compression and rarefaction. During the transition between these regions the temperature and pressure vary adiabatically.\nWe can calculate the speed of sound using conservation and momentum equations to derive it as a function of the derivative of pressure with respect to density. With more rearranging with adiabatic relations and ideal gas law, we can derive a function for the speed of sound with respect to temperature and gas constants.\nThis allows us to rewrite equations in terms of Mach number rather than velocity and density because writing in terms of Mach number and gamma is more useful in incompressible fluid dynamics then writing in velocity and density as we are used to.",

    "question": "What is a choked flow? What are two ways for a flow to reach Mach 1?",
    "answer": "Using conservation of mass, the 1D Euler equation, and the definition of the speed of sound, we can derive an equation that solves for the change in area as a function of Mach Number and acceleration.\nWhen viewing the equation it beomces evident that when M = 1, dA/dx must be equla to zerom, indicating a minimum area. This region of minimum area is called the throat, and if M = 1 is reached, we can say the throat is choked. This means if the incoming flow is M < 1, and the throat is choked, then the resulting flow will be supersonic.\nSince one way to choke a flow is reducing the area, another way this could be acheived is reducing the effective area through friction. Increasing the Mach Number using a converging nozzle is equivalent to increasing the Mach Number through a rough pipe.",

    "question": "How do expansion fans differ from shocks? What causes their properties to change after the expansion/shock?",
    "answer": "Expansion fans are defined as a continuous sequence of Mach Waves. Mach waves change the flow by a dtheta and dv. They are generated as supersonic flow passes by a convex corner.\nShocks are created in supersonic flow passing by a concave corner (oblique shock) or just in supersonic flow (normal shock). This occurs because when flow is supersonic, the fluid blobs that normally react in density variations cannot move in time. Shocks are an intense build up of pressure that result in a drop in stagnation pressure.\nUnlike shocks, expansion fans are isentropic. This means that stagnation temperature and stagnation pressure are constant before and after the expansion fan. In a shock, Mach number decrease while in an expansion fan, Mach number increases. In a shock, density increases, static pressure increases, and static enthalpy increases. In an expansion fan, density decreases, static pressure decreases, and static enthalpy decreases.",
